# Prerequisites
 - A Windows laptop/computer
 - Visual Studio

# Organization
Each folder is numbered in recommended order of viewing.
<br>Each folder will introduce a new concept
<br>Each concept will be explained in the code.
<br>
<br>I recommend that you don't copy-paste the code, but rather read through it to get an understanding.
<br>Each program's code will have a section at the start (in light grey), explaining what is going on.
<br>When required, there will be some explainations in code as well.
<br>The *code.vb* **cannot be run** by you. Only the *app.exe* can.

# I wanna run it
The *code.vb* is able to be viewed in the browser, or downloaded.
<br>Each folder will also contain an *app.exe* that you can download and run to test and see what the program does.
<br>Enjoy and Good Luck!

# P.S.
You may get a warning that it is from an unrecognized author. **This warning can be wholly ignored (for this case).**
You will also find a video on how to run the apps, and remember it is generally not a good idea to download random apps from the internet and run.
<br>
<br>Do note that nowadays, many browsers won't allow you to download exe's straight from websites, so the easiest option would be to click the green button saying "clone or download", and then download as zip. This will save all the files available at that point of time to be viewed later. Check back soon in case I have updated or added any files!
