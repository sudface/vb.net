<br>Each folder is numbered in recommended order of viewing.
<br>Each folder will introduce a new concept
<br>Each concept will be explained in the code.
<br>
<br>I recommend that you don't copy-paste the code, but rather read through it to get an understanding.
<br>Each program's code will have a section at the start (in light grey), explaining what is going on.
<br>When required, there will be some explainations in code as well.
<br>Enjoy and Good Luck!
